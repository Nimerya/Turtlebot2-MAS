The project work aims to implement a *multi-agent system* that is responsible of providing assistance to warehouse personnel. 
The fleet is composed by *Kobuki Turtlebot2* units, the scene represents a warehouse in which a conveyor belt carries packages into the room.
Since the Turtlebot2 units are not provided with arms, one or more operators are needed to help with the fetching/placing of the packages in the respective shelves.
